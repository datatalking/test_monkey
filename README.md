# LPTHW
My kata for Zed Shaw's Learn Python The Hard Way

## Causal Abstract
A theory on robust education methods to engrain deep model or mathmatical expertise.
1. Open LPTHW on 1/2 of left monitor, sublime on 2/2 of left monitor
2. Open terminal on 1/3 of right monitor, webbrowser on 2/3 of right
3. Work through his tutorial, retype KATA class creator... need to find it.

A daily routine of practice until you can't get it wrong while maintaining a variable balance betweeen creation and discovery of your highest pritority.

This repo uses material sourced from Zed's work and I added a bit of my own utility to the code as well as some django servings.

# starting
1.01 this presuposes you have git, pip, python and have a directory you are pulling from. (maybe one day I will have a root start .sh routine (someday))
1.02 from bash cli (terminal) type mkdir then the name of the directory that you want to create. for Zed Shaw's Learn Python The Hard Way i named the directory LPTHW... see what I did there.
1.03 to get started type 'git clone https://github.com/datatalking/LPTHW' into the bash command line.
2. then you need to type up the next lesson
  2a. if you have never done git, first type git status
  2b. you should see  'On branch master
    Then Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

    nothing to commit, working tree clean'
3. "git init" creates a repo, only do thisthen commit the data back with the git command list.
4. "git add ." adds all to commit stage (not sure about recusive subs)
5. "git commit -m 'message' " pushes the command back to the repo
6. "git checkout -b '<branch name>' " then hit enter, then type "git branch" to confirm you wanted this done.
7. "git push" should show something like
    * "Enumerating objects: 15, done.
    * Counting objects: 100% (15/15), done.
    * Delta compression using up to 8 threads
    * Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
    * Writing objects: 100% (8/8), 989 bytes | 989.00 KiB/s, done.
    * Total 8 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0)
    * remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (5/5), completed with 5 local objects.
    * To https://github.com/datatalking/LPTHW.git
    * 882d9a7..1794c77  master -> master"
